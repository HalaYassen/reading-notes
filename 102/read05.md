## summarize the Operators and Loops
when we use loops in code, that's means code can take more than one path, and the browser runs different code in different situations depends how user interacte with system.
* this can determine by the following :
1- evaluation: in the section the programmer analyze values in scripts to determine whether or note they match expected results.
2- decisions and loops: Using the results from previous step to decide which path the script should drop or do.
loop: There are also many occasions where the programmer want to execute the same set of steps repeatedly
* decision making depends in condition that mean the programmer have to write different code for each bath (if true do this , if false do another thing)
* ther are two main things to a decision :
1- evaluate the expression (check the current status), and this thing return value 
2- a condision statments says what to do in that situation, in this stage code execute one starment or more depends in what inside the if and what inside the else 
* while loop to check the user interacte correctlly with system because we never trust what the type of data the user has been entered.
