in this decumentation I will talk about Growth mindset. 

#### in this article we will explane what is the specific meaning of Growth Mindset
When someone has a growth mindset they believe that they can continue to learn and become more intelligent with effort.  In contrast, someone who has a fixed mindset believes that they are born with a certain amount of talent and intelligence and that cannot be improved no matter how much effort they put forth.

Having a growth mindset is something that employers are always looking for.  If you believe that you can learn and become more skilled and intelligent you will be a harder worker and you will excel in whatever you do.  As a student, you will be open to learning new things and new information will come easily to you.

##### HOW can I have Growth mindset ?
It is important to talk to yourself a lot with positive talk, especially the hours before bedtime because the brain will store this new information and work to prove it. Hence the importance of self-stimulation. 
It's also important to surround yourself with positive people who destroy you when you make mistakes and don't make fun of you.
