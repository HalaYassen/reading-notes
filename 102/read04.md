# summrized the javaScript
from this reading i have learned the script is a series  of instruction, computer follow this instruction
to achieve some target ,this instruction computer follow it one by one.
###### another important thing the browser can use many part of script, and that depends on how the user interacts with the web page.
To write a script I must follow some steps like
1-specify the goals or what i want to do excatlly.
2-divided the big task to sub_task and thinking how i wanna to solf this 
group of task with out any collision or mistakes.
3-code each step, the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the computer
understands it, so in this step I need to know what is the words that comuter understand, and 
how I put this word in form to make the instruction.
*  I have know why we need flowcharts, it's help me to understand how scripts work while i'm in
the process of learning the language.
* A computer hasn't know what a hotel or car or any object on the world, It does not know what any objects in real worlds used for, or why we need it, computer just make a model of any object we wants by the data which come from programmers and this data describe the object ,each object can have its own (Properties,Events,Methods).
* Script use different event to trigger different types of functionality, so script will state which events the programmer wants to respond to, and what part of the script should be run when event occur.
Methods represent thing need to do with objects, and it can
retrieve or update the values of properties, and it shows how people
interact with object in life, and one method contain a number of instruction, this instuction called one task
page using JavaScript, you need to know how a browser interprets the
HTML code and applies styling to it by
1-receive a page as HTML code.
2-create a model on the page and stored it in memory
3-use a rendering because that content need to show on user screen
* then browser take the javaScript code and translate it into instruction which is called scripting engine or interpreter
* to fit javaScript with HTML and CSS, I have been known the HTML called content layer and CSS presentation layer (which design the code)and javaScript is the behaviour layer 
* the good practice in javaScript code is put the code in the new file which commen use name the file app.js and copy the link of this file into the html page like this structure :"The HTML script element is used in HTML pages, it's regularly put it in the end of body tag
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file " because we always need to show page to the user not blank page until javaScript code loaded.
* javaScript is case sensitive and we don't use the space if we need to declire a variable which contains more than one words we use in this case things that means camle case which the second words must begin with big letter.
* to determine comment in javaScript we have two ways 
1- we use // befor each line ,and this appear in gray line
2- we use at begin of line /* and end line with */ "this way commenlly use if the comment more than one line, this appear with green line
* there are many types of data type in javaScript :"string,number,boolean"
