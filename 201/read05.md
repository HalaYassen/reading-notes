# Chapter 5 : Images
website includde an image : you might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart.Images can be used to set the tone for a site in less time than it takes to read a description.


**How we can add Images?**
To add an image into the page you need to use an `<img>` element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag) with two attributes:

* *src*: to tells the browser where it can find the image file.

* *alt*: by using this attr. you can typr a text, so it is provides a text description of the image, and you can use title to provide additional information about the image!

<spain style="color:white">let show an Example : </spain>

`<img src="Ogasa_Photo_2.jpg" alt="land of ice" title="this pictur taked in Arctic"/>`

**It will be As**

![ice_land](Ogasa_Photo_2.jpg)



## Extra attributes for Img : 

* *height*: This to specifies the height of the image in pixel(px)

* *width*: This to specifies the width of the image in pixel(px)

if we apply the previous attribute to the image the result will be : 

`<img src="Ogasa_Photo_2.jpg" alt="land of ice" title="this pictur taked in Arctic" width="400" height="500" />`


<img src="Ogasa_Photo_2.jpg" alt="land of ice" title="this pictur taked in Arctic" width="400" height="500" />


* Where we can put images in a Code?

inside the start of a paragraph, before a paragraph, in the middle of a paragraph.

* we now need how we can Creat Image  : Save images in the right format, Save images in the right size, Save images in the right resolution. 

**Images should be** : Convey information, Fit the color palette, Be instantly recognisable, Convey the right mood, Be relevant.


we have many tools to Edit, and Save  the image
most popular tools amongst web professionals is **Adobe Photoshop** and here is an other Software :

1. Adobe Fireworks
2. Pixelmator
3. PaintShop Pro
4. Paint.net

* what is the  `<figcaption>`?

the <figcaption> element has been added to HTML version 5, in order to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image. Before these elements were created there was no way to associate an `<img>` element with its caption.

Use GIF or PNG or JPNG format when saving images with few colors or large areas of the same color.

# Chapter 11 : “Color”

In this section, we will look at how to make your web pages more attractive, controlling the design of them using CSS,  CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear.

A CSS rule contains two parts: 
 1. selector:  

Selectors indicate which element the rule applies to. 

 2. declaration:

Declarations indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled.
Declarations are split into two parts (a property and a value),and are separated by a colon.


* We Can use CSS In :
Inline : It’s used to apply css style for a one element. Internal : style You can also include CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside a style element External : The link element can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page. It is an empty element (meaning it does not need a closing tag), and it lives inside the head element.It should use three attributes: href ,type, ```rel``
