# what google learn from it's quest to build good team :

from the previous article there is a person that name Julia, graduated from Yale School of Management. and works in google in In 2012, she start work in project that name Aristotle, this project start from google to study a many numbers of google’s teams and figure out why some  of the groups faced  a problem and decrease in there behavior , and  other groups are increased.

the first step in this project is study the previous academic studying, if is the best group is consist of people that share the same behaviors and share the same backgrounds of studying, if the member of the same group share the feelings and other things with each other, like they have dinner or lunch with each others, or the shy is the best thing to be sit in the hole group member ! they drew diagrams, and studied how long teams stuck together, and if gender is effect on a team’s success!

from this study Julia and the teams who works in the Aristotle project found some groups in Google for example, were consist of friends who knows each other outside work. but others were made up of people who were strangers basically away from the conference room!

the team focused on what are known as group norms, which is behavioral and unwritten rules that control how we interact  when we gather.

one of the teams reaches that avoid the disagreement is more valuable than debate, team members may be  behave in different ways like prefer to work independently but during the meet  the group’s norms always override individual activities and encourage deference to the team.

during this study they faced many tips of members, like teammates interrupted one another, and that team leaders support that behavior by interrupting others by themselves but in the another groups, leaders enforced conversational order, and when someone cut off a teammate, members politely ask everyone to wait own turn, as soon as meetings began the introverts came out of their shells.

After studying many behavioral groups for more than one  year, researchers reached  that understanding and influencing group norms is the keys to improve google’s teams and any teams in the world! 

researchers eventually concluded that the difference between  good teams from the bad was how teammates treated with each other, that means  right norms could raise a group’s collective intelligence, but the wrong norms could destroyed the team.


after studied a huge numbers of the groups, the researchers noticed tow behaviors the first one is  in all good teams: members spoke in roughly the same proportion,  and which is referred to as Equality in distribution of conversational, the second one is the good teams had  average social sensitivity!

note: The simplest ways to gauge on  social sensitivity is  show someone photos of people’s eyes and asked to describe what the people are feeling in that time, which is known as reading the mind in the eyes exam!

data indicated that psychological safety was critical to making a team work, more than anything else. and establishing psychological safety is messy and difficult to implement. for example you can tell people to don't cut off others member during the conversation, and listen to another carefully, and you can noticed them to be sensitive to how their friends feel and be ware when someone seems upset. 

At the end Julia and others who work in the project figured out which norms are very important, which is that the communication and empathy is main things to make real connections between members in the team!

in general this project  is a reminder that when companies try to optimize everything, it’s sometimes easy to forget that success is often built on experiences like emotional interactions and conversations, discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel.

**Best sentence ever in this article is when Rozovsky said. ‘‘Don’t underestimate the power of giving people a common platform and operating language.’’ !!!!**
