* Key Concepts in Positioning Elements

Building Blocks: CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level which start in a new line box or, inline box. 

Containing Elements: If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.

**CSS has the three positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page:**

* 1-normal flow

* 2-relative positioning.

* 3- absolute positioning.

* To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use box offset properties if it fixed positioning or floating elements
